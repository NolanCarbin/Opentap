Full-stack web-based application that lets users view, add, and update brewery information based on their authorization level. Developed a RESTful API server and utilized Axios to consume endpoints from front-end. Back-end developed and tested using IntelliJ. Postman used to test API functionality. Front-end developed using Vue.js, and Database created and managed with PostgreSQL and DbVisualizer.
